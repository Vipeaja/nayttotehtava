                This is a classic show but only the first 20 season are worth watching I mean after they were bought by Disney they went down hill.

                It's great and funny the first 20 seasons and then it just gets tiring and the humor is more for kids and family.

                I have to give the simpsons credit. They have been around for 11 years and is still one of the most popular shows. Sometimes (most of the time) their funny and other times, are serious. I give the show a 9 out of 10.

                This is the best show. I love the Simpsons I've almost watched every episode! I have a Simpsons guide book of every episode from seasons 1 to 8. My favorite one is Bart. I can't Believe they've gone 12 seasons (12 years) and I heard there's going to be be a 13th season!

                This show could probably have 3 to 4 different ratings depending on the era. This show has spanned 30+ seasons. For me the first 10-11 seasons would be easily a 10. The first couple aren't great, but are still entertaining, season 3 is when it became great. It slowly goes down hill after that, before the bottom drops out. The show needs to end, it's well past its sell by date.

So an overall 8 is very generous in my estimation. For someone who has never seen it, stick to seasons 3 through 10.

                It's very hard for me to try to put a rating on this show. At one time it was the best comedy series on TV and possibly even the best one ever. Unfortunately it went into a decline after the first ten years or so, and then a steep decline, to the point where it is less than a shadow of what it once was. They really should have quit several years ago, but at this point they might as well just keep going and see how many episodes they can rack up before the plug is finally pulled.
